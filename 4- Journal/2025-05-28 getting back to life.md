I am officially out of the army and have been trying to get back to life and what I was doing before, and now I want to do pretty much every thing, not just what I couldn't do in army but also many new things that I learned about in that year.

I also need to reorganize my life, my house, my computer, phone, and HDD, setup my code editor for my current work and learning stacks, make projects, talk more on twitter, make more posts and videos, and many more things that just come and never stop coming. I know I have finite time and I can't do everything, but I also understand the most important things that I have to do and to what extent I can do any thing I want.

I also tried to use a local LLM for vs code chat and auto complete features, from twitter I got great help and resources for the idea, some people suggested places to get free online models, and some shared their experience that it needs a powerful GPU to get something going.
