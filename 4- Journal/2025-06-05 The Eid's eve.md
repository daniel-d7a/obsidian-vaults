The Eid is tomorrow, and to be frank the last few where making me anxious, I have to be happy and greet people and social and tack photos yada yada and you know what, sometimes I don't, I simply don't want to smile or be happy.

This eid is different tho, I am out of the army at last, and I am happy for real this time, and I have outings planned for the days of Eid.

What did I do today, I continued coding the inertia blog, now we have a type safe router, I also tried to generate types for the frontend from the models but failed, I swear there were articles about it but they just vanished.

I want to vlog the building of the blog in a playlist called "the blog vlog"

I also cleaned the fridge really good, and washed everything, and organized stuff in containers, and I made a lot of jello with bananas, and I mean a lot, I will be eating it for the whole month.

I have some bananas and lots of grapes, and some cucumber and carrots.

I talked to my friends, gigo has a startup idea, and it seems great, and I will definitely work with him on it, we also discussed the "date" I am having on the 2nd day of Eid, we shall just wait and see how that turns out.

I had fun talking to them, we haven't talked in a while like this.

Gotta take a shower, iron my clothes, and be on my merry way.
