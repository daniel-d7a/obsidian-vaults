[[Journal]]

nothing much, just trying to find stable work and also work on myself.

I signed the deal with hash plus, the deal is to record videos for the course (in this case web, html, css, js) and get payed 4500 egp (and another 1000 if all ends well), in my opinion, the money is little, but after I calculated it it is not that bad, however, I am getting into this while looking to what could come out of them in the future.

I also set up my phone to be able to read and highlight the readings in it, and woke up the book club group, I want to read more, use socials less.
