[[Journal]]
What to say here?
- less eating out, more cooking at home (or preparing smarter, cheaper meals).
- tried to organize a day with the guys, didn't prepare anything else, and they bailed on me.
- bought a mic (very nice, but also way more expensive than I had in mind).
- put an order for the phone tripod, going to arrive in a few days.
- got a course to prepare for, I am kinda okay but I know I got to prepare well for it.
- finished 1 typescript migration, second is undergoing.

All I want to do is to finish the book, and prepare a few videos, these are my only goals now.

I have been off social media for a week now, I only get on for a few minutes every few days and from the laptop, it is great, now I gotta get to creation.
