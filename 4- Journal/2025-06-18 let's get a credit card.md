I went to the bank to get a credit card and it was quite a ride to do so while working freelance-ish, and also I decided to go so early that the whole town was asleep, I had to go far and beyond to find a copy place so I can copy some papers. and I also needed to use almost all the money I had (3k) to open the account, so I am now treading on thin ice.

but It should only be 2 weeks and I will get the money back and a credit card, and also the bank teller told me that it wasn't that hard to make a credit card that allows us to pay in USD, so I am making one sooner or later.
