I don't know what to do with myself, I slept through 2 days, haven't done nothing, if I didn't have food for yesterday god knows what was I gonna do today.

I worked a bit on f5 api, I need to work on it more tomorrow, and I have a shit ton of recording to do, I am waaaay behind schedule, I need to prepare and I can't film right now because Bahaa is here and he is asleep right behind me, the sound of my keyboard is annoying enough.

I need to cook food, and prepare material to be filmed and uploaded, and film my own goddamn video for my bloody channel, and to make matters a bit worse, I have a session with Tarek tomorrow, and I was kicked from my group at Ersaa for some reason, I don't know did we get here,

Oh and also Salma is not replying or replying late with a few words and it makes me wanna start a fight but who am I or what is it even about, that is very stupid and I don't know how to handle this maturely enough. I want her attention without looking desperate or suggesting anything, how does one manage that?

One would say that part of love is being desperate for your lover, but can I really do that? or how can I do it in a way that shows my noble intentions? I want her to know that I like talking to her and being around her, because everyday she proves to be more and more of an interesting person, but I have no idea what to do about that.
