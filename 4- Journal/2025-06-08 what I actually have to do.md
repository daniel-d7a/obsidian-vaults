[[Journal]]

I have been using social media a lot lately, watching a lot of youtube, and playing a lot. what I actually need to do is start making stuff, so I will start by listing some video ideas that I want to make and start working on them right away.

I need to be creating, I have been consuming for far too long.

I want to sit on my computer and make scripts for videos and posts, no social media, less youtube and gaming, use them as a reward after creating something.

so as of now, I want to make

- that interview video task
- the inertia blog vlog
- the docker video
- the [[useSyncExternalStore article]] that just doesn't want to come to an end.

If I hadn't written about the interview, I applied to be an instructor at a saudi company called hash plus, and I got accepted, so now I have to give them a taste of what I teach like, so they gave me some material and asked me to make a video with it.
