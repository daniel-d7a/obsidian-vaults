I will try to instead of going on social media (which I do less of now, thanks to time limits and work, although I need to work a bit more on my free time after work and in the weekends) I will work on something, and I learned that I can't work on multiple things at once, I work much better when I focus on one or two things.

I will set my goal for now to finish 1948, review my german and take new lessons everyday, and working on head first design patterns videos. Only these 3 things for now, and everyone should have its time, I will put before bed to reading a book, 30 mins through out the day to work on the videos, and after work for my german lessons.

I need:
- stuff to remind me to stay on track
- to put time for social media that I shall not exceed
- to contain other distractions (YouTube, clash royale)

I will stay on this system for a month, and hopefully by then it should work on auto pilot.

I want to create a life system that pushes me to create, to learn, that pushes me towards my goals.

In other news, work has been great, although I am working too much, I am also learning a lot, I feel more confident working with laravel and the backend in general I feel like I can see issues arise and learn new ways to solve them (AI is being a great ally here), and the more I keep at it the more I know where my weaknesses are and what I need to learn next.

Also work is giving me full control of everything, I can change the code structure, take decisions, I am in charge of the whole pipeline, I am going to integrate more services to use in the project or aid in development.

The other major thing is my finances, they are ok, but I strive for better, I am looking for ways in which I can invest My money and get a any kind of continues profit, getting freelance jobs is okay but they take time and I already work too much, I am trying to find a service that I can provide and charge for on monthly bases, I am still considering the hosting gig, and I am going to start with a small server soon enough.
