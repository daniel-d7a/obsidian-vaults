First of all I've had the whole week very light on work, I continued the typescript migrations and finished the instructor as well, I fix almost all the bugs that emerged after the migrations, and some more not related to the migrations, did some UI enhancements, did one mini feature, nothing major this week.

I also put the order and collected the small tripod, which was the last piece in the setup, now I can get back to making videos.

Having this light of a week (along with the failure to arrange any outings this week) made me realize that I might be sinking too much into work, almost on the brim of being a workaholic, or that I have no life outside of work, but the thing is that I try my best not to leave what I am used to, or what I feel comfortable with, in the mean time that is work.

Don't get me wrong, my work is great, I enjoy it, and I have put my self to believe that it isn't just my 9-5, I use it for far more, at work I can experiment, I learn new things, I try things on my own, I ask questions and meet scenarios, so it is good, the bad thing is doing it too much, I want other things in life as much as I want to be a good worker.

I want to go out and meet my friends, however  many times that has proved difficult, I want to revive my YouTube channel, I want to game, I want to do pointless but fun stuff and share them with the world.

And to do this I need to let go of work for a little bit, or rather I need something to pull me away from work, I recently heard of someone who uses the alarm app to remind him of doing stuff, which I think is a brilliant idea, but besides it I need to allocate time to my side quests, and I need to set a system with clear goals.

Other than that I just gotta stick to it as much as I could.
