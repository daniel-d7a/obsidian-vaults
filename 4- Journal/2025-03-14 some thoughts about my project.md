one thing that hit me today was that there are many local (or at least in the MENA region) competitors to my SaaS idea, many that are better, cheaper, offer more features, and overall make my idea worthless.

competitors include: -

- shahbandar
- wuilt
- zid
- expand cart

but that won't deter me from my idea, as I told you my idea was never to compete in the first place, the success of my idea was split into 3 levels: -

1. **being a portfolio piece,** which is like, default success, if I just made a working prototype I will have succeeded in this part.
2. **serving some of my own clients,** I don't want to be the tool for every one, I just want to suit the needs of my own clients and be able to charge them money for it.
3. **gaining a wider audience,** if the idea took off on its own and got a few more clients, or got big enough to need expanding on the infrastructure or spending money on it then that is okay, I won't say no to that.
