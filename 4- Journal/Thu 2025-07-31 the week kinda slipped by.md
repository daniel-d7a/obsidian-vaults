Sooooooooooooo, 

I didn't do much this week, one reason for this was that I mostly woke up in a hurry for something, or overslept, so I didn't put my day plan, so I didn't do much.

Another reason was that there wasn't much work to do anyway, my fulltime job was slow, my part time was slower, a very chill week.

I didn't study Deutsch, didn't watch the Nuxt course, didn't play that much, didn't work on my inertia project, didn't solve any problems, didn't watch nothing, didn't make or prepare any videos.

However, I started going to the gym, I went 4 days this week, and to sum my experience, waking up to fake love doesn't hurt half as much.

But I can see myself going to the gym for a while, my brother goes, my cousin goes, and one of their friends goes as well, the gym is nice, people are friendly, and it is a step that I for long postponed, so it it time.

Also 2 important events happened this week. First, I went out with salma one more time, it has been over a month and a half since I last (or first) saw her, but this time it was different.

I remember saying I was having mixed feelings about her, don't want her to be "the only girl that is close to me" or just "the first available girl" but when we went out my brain got all the answers it needed.

She is gorgeous (irl, for some reason her photos can't capture her beautiful side, and that is on the cameras, of course), even though I didn't knew her long enough we have connected quick and deeply, we share stuff, I listen to her ramble and she listens to me, online and more so irl.

Beside being cute, she is playful, fun, outgoing, but also smart, knows her worth, knows right from wrong, knows how to set boundaries with others, and most importantly, she knows what she wants in life, and what she wants in a man.

I felt a deep connection with her that second time, and somehow us talking made me want to ask her to be mine more and more as we talked.

We had food, drinks, we walked in a street full of antiques, we went to a play, we had ice cream, and all of that was better because she was around, it wasn't just doing stuff, it was doing stuff with her.

Few other things that happened as we talked, we matched our humor, she talked about us casually (while I try to steer away from the subject as to not be weird or make her uncomfortable), at the end of the night she opened up to me and told me about her fears, what she is missing in her life, what keeps her awake at night, she misses a life partner, someone who would keep her company and console her when she needs it the most, all that made want to be by her more.

The second major event that happened right after we went out is that I made her made, crazy right, well it was something very little that would otherwise would have went by (I mocked her nose for being big, but for the record I felt bad about it just a few hours later and deleted it) she saw it, got mad and stayed silent for 2 days, untill I nudged her one too many times that she opened up about my comment being mean, I tried to keep talking to her, but she kinda needed time, I tried calling, I apologized, again and again, told her I never meant to make her feel bad.

She talked to me after, we had a little chat about the situation, I apologized again, she said it was fine but I think she is still little mad with me.

This has a bright side to it though, I feel every relationship, wether friendship, partnership, or any other ship, needs some disagreement, that shall either break it or make it stronger, in this situation it is the latter I hope, for I won't be happy losing this one, especially over something so pity.
