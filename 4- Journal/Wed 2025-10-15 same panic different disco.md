What changed since last time I wrote here?

The old company let go of me after my probation period, there has been many things from both sides that could have been the reason, but the end result is the same.

It wasn't a bad job, and I made some connections and learned many new things, now I need to move on.

EGP 31, the event at eraasoft where we celebrate student achievements, discuss projects, and give away certificates, it was nice, and most importantly it was a nice change of pace. Since I stopped overworking myself and started going out and meeting people live became more lively and vibrant.

But that is causing a struggle within me, I want to have a lot of money, I always feel like my money is worthless unless I earn (not own) a lot of it, and to own a lot I need to be better and work more, and to be better you need time to study and work on side projects (and to take a breath from working and studying) and in the end all I get is frustrated and burnt out.

How does one achieve stuff in this life?

I feel like I don't know what to do, that I want it all, I want to have my cake and eat it, I want to see people, to play, to earn, to be better every day

I now work for eraasoft as a full stack developer, working on the platform, hybrid, 3-4 days from the office, not a bad job, however I don't know when do I clock off, most people are like that there, we just exist there.

I still work for ersaa, which sucks ass, time consuming, pays like shit, unfulfilling, I can't wait for it to finish, then maybe I will have some time to go out and live.

Then there is my brother, I used to tend to him, now I can barely make food or clean or whatever, I don't know if what I do is right or am I just fucking everything 

I don't know what I should be doing, all I know is that whatever I do I feel miserable.

I should live day by day, stop worrying about everything, I also don't know how to do that.

I want to be better than this, I feel like I am not doing enough for myself, my brother, or my future, such a shitty feeling.

How does one know and feel that he is doing his best, how does one escape this cycle of hell.
