Going to the office a few days a week, seeing people, messing with your work mates, touching grass,talking with a distant friend, all that was the key to get out of the spiral of panic and doom that I was in.

All that is left now is to finish that book and let go of my phone.

Life seemed to go on unbotherd as usual, yes there are some nuances here and there but life will sort itself out.

What I need to do now is to go slow, dance a little cha cha cha with life, and you know what I didn't notice till now, life was throwing lemons at me all that time, and it was only satisfied once I (literally) made lemonade.

Now what about women, I met a two at work, both are super friendly and sweet, one is much cuter though, and she was breathing in that blue dress, and we all seem to get along, but as we know from previous experience, relationships take time, and easy come easy go.

Yeah, they still cross my mind every now and then, but I have to accept that it is what it is, they weren't in my fate, meaning that it is still yet to come, and I just have to go on with my life thinking very little about it, as that is fate, it hits when you least expect it.
