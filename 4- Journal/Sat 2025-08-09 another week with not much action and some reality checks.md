This week wasn't very different from the last one, I didn't do much more than was expected from me, work, online sessions, meetings, ...etc.

Didn't do much for myself, my courses had to extend their break, gamed a little, no reading, no Quran, only went to the gym for the last 2 days, wanted to record a video but didn't, and I had no plan and didn't know what to do most of the time.
This week I have a clearer vision and will try to be more structured and put down a plan in advance.

What about the other things? You ask.
Well regarding Salma, a conclusion was reached that we need more time - and I mean more as in a few months to a year - to know her better and really figure out if this is the right person be with.

also Bahaa and Gigo hit me with a few reality checks regarding Salma and my life as a whole, I feel pressured that's for sure, most of the people my age and in my situation sure do, but the told me that there is no rush for anything, and when you need to do something we will find a way to do it.

Salma isn't the last girl on earth whom I would like in this way, there are plenty of fish in the sea, as much as this phrase is true I don't like to hear it in this situation. However people come and go, and If Salma is in my fate then I shall have her, and if not then another girl shall come.

I was working so hard (and so many jobs) in order to save as much money as I could so that I can spoil myself and save a lump sum (just in case), that in it self isn't wrong, but doing it excessively is wrong and messes with my work-life balance.

They told me just go steady, don't rush things, nothing to rush for, you will get there eventually (I doubt it in this economy but who am I to judge), and most importantly focus on one thing (okay maybe not exactly one but just fewer things) at a time.

Also yeah I am going to save some of my money and use the rest to spoil myself and get me the stuff that I want that's why I work isn't it. I will try to put down a plan of why am I saving and what do I want the money for and try to work it that way.

It isn't just about money you know, some of it is experimenting with new things, like how to balance a life with wants and need, how to balance life with work, how to deal with freelance projects, learning new technologies, how to deal with money and what to do with it, how to finance the things that I want.

Back to my (non-existent) love life, one of my reasons of perusing it is that I feel I need someone in my life, many of my closest connections are very distant now, my friends here, my friends in Cairo, even online people, and also many of the real people who don't like doing online.

I want to have people keep me company, tell me about their days, their lives, their feelings and fears, I want to deepen my connection with my people, I feel some very odd kind of loneliness.
