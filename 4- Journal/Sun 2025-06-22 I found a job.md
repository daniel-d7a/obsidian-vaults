I found a job, one company that I interviewed with has accepted me and we agreed on the net salary (10k for the first 3 months and 12k afterwards), and that feels great, I didn't want to stay unemployed for long and I didn't, now I am working not one, not 2, but maybe 4 jobs / contracts.

I also joined and talked in a twitter space for the first time, it was nice connecting with people, and Ayman, my friend from college, actually only recognized me from that twitter space.
