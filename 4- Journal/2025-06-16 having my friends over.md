Today I slept mostly, then bebo and mahameho both wanted to come over, and of course I said yes, it was a blast, we had food, drinks (top cola) fruit, nuts, music, YouTube, movies, games, and everything.

We did the usual, not that the usual is bad, but you know, movies, eating whatever, cooking together, played card games, talked about girls (more about that soon), and everything in between.

Of course we had some time to go deep, bebo vented about his house and father, I talked about work and what is my plan, bebo also had an idea about teaching programming for kids (which we all hate), so he was thinking about raising awareness to parents about why it is better for your child to do literally anything else than learning programming at this young age, he wanted to show how this is for the children's benefits and not out of jealousy or hate for all those academies out there wasting everyone's time and parents money.

I also had a few things happen work wise, I got a simple phone screening call about a frontend position from the 50 something I applied to, they liked my resume, asked me a few questions, and we scheduled an interview for the 18th Of May at 8 pm, I hope it turns out good. 

I also got referred to a few positions, which was a little surprising that someone would do that for me, I got referred to 2 positions af VOIS, 1 senior and 1 tech lead, both frontend, both I am not qualified for but hey, it is the gesture that counts, I also applied for both non the less.

I got another referral, this time for a call center customer service position in English at teleperformance, I kindly declined it and offered to refer someone else instead, but again, the thought tah counts.

And the current project that I am working at I also got thanks to a connection, and many many more opportunities, that made me thankful for my connections, those who I know dearly and others who I don't know just as well, and also kinda showed me the results of working with other people, creating content, spreading knowledge, it showed me the real power of working with the people for the people.
