Hi, I haven't been here for a while, I was and is still busy, and I don't know or understand how I am putting everything together.

I know have completed hash plus videos, so the only obligation with them will be some live sessions throughout the week and they pay really well.

I started working fulltime as a frontend developer from home at the same time with another developer who also works with eraasoft , and it is going great so far, we only get small tasks but we got along together and with the other emplyees great, and I am liking the new challenge, working on and refactoring a large and growing project like that, making decisions, debugging existing code, and trying to maintain a level of consistency in the code base while also making it a bit better every time.

I am also almost completely vibe coding the F5 API, and it is going great so far and we have done a lot of the work in an appropriate amount of time.

I also started with eraasoft, I have a course every Friday in Alexandria, and I am loving it, alex is great, and has great weather this time of the year, I love the people of eraasoft, I love my new batch of students, and all the videos I have done for hash plus have set me up good for this, I have almost revised the entire course for the videos, and I will enjoy going to Alex every week, it is like a (very enjoyable) forced outing every week to see the sea and eat out.

another thing that I am doing is I took to solve problems with a sophomore called seif, he can code but he can't problem solve, so we spend 1 hour 2 days a week solving problems on codeforces, I will admit I am not the best when it comes to problem solving but I can hold my weight and I can explain the problems well enough, and it doesn't take much time and it pays fairly.

the only thing that I am doing but not liking is teaching kids, it is slow, painful, and I don't see what's in it for them, I love teaching but this is wasted effort for me and them, and I don't like being around little kids for too long, I am not that lovable and I hate putting up a face for too long.

with all that work comes some sacrifices, I don't get enough sleep or I have to sleep twice throughout the day, after a week or so of little and bad sleep my body sometimes gives up on me and sleeps for 12 hours straight.

I also play very little, and have taken a break from learning deutsch as my day is very unorganized and many things happen everyday and stuff can just show up anytime.

I take little time for myself or my side project or my channel, and I don't like that, I speak too little with my friends and can't or don't go out of the house unless it is very important. hopefully the Friday course will fix that, and maybe I could plan some day out with friends some time.

one upside of all of this is that I should be showered with money soon, and sadly we live in a capitalist world where we trade our lives for money then we spend absurd amounts of money to feel like we still own our lives, and that is exactly what I am going to do, I will make some big purchase once I get payed.

I will try to keep this updated for the sake of my sanity
