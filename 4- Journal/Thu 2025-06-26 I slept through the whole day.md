[[Journal]]

I am writing this at 4 in the morning, I slept through the day, I did nothing, I woke up 3 times and in all of them I went back to sleep doing nothing.

I also had to embarrassingly cancel many things that I was supposed to do today last minute, like Tarek's session, sessions with Ersaa, and I know nothing about the work I have to do or what happened throughout the day.

I need to get back onto stuff, to get reorganized, I am going to write a note with all that I have to do and get onto it.

Also I am seeing that my house is getting dirty all over again, I need to get on top of that.

This is me from the future, I haven't done much that day, barely organized my tasks, started working a bit then felt dizzy and went back to sleep, missed Jumaa prayer and most of Friday even.
