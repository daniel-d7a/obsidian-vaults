This is yet another weekend from the army where I feel like shit, waste a lot of time not doing what I want or pursuing weird stuff that have no meaning or purpose.

I want to know what is happening and why, I have been feeling down since I came and even a little before, this is stopping me from doing what I actually want to do even gaming and I don't even have a reason for it.

I will just push through this one and try to finish the videos in time at least. but we can't keep going like this, I know we technically can, but that is not a way to live.
