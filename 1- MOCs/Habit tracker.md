## Insights about my habits

- I tend to do the things that I am already doing more than the things I haven't started already.
- there are many things that happen outside of my control, so I might not do every thing every day.
- there are many more things that I want to like food prep, going to the gym, watching stuff as entertainment, …etc. but this is a solid list.
