**cross context learning**: look at someone from another field using a tool, then apply the learning to your own field.  

## writing

use AI to ask follow up question about topics I am working on.

> use AI to pull stuff out of me rather than do the work for, the seed of the idea is coming from me and the AI is only augmenting it.

## analytics

I can give it any data such as my YouTube data, and make AI analyze it for me and give me suggestions based on it, maybe videos to make, ideas, video titles, topics, and more.

## personal life

it works as a tour guide, and can organize tours for you.

it can suggest presents.
