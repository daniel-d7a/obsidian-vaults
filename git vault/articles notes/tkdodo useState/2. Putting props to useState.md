We have a list of persons, and selecting one of them will result in a detail form being filled. We want to show the persons' email address in the detail form, and also have an apply button that will update that data.

We are setting the details state initial value to the selection value passed as props.  The initial value of a useState hook is always discarded on re-renders - it only has an effect when the component mounts.

```
const persons = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Dominik',
    email: 'dominik@dorfmeister.cc',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'John',
    email: 'john@doe.com',
  },
]

function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(persons[0])

  return (
    <div>
      {persons.map((person) => (
        <button
          type="button"
          key={person.id}
          onClick={() => setSelected(person)}
        >
          {person.id === selected.id
            ? person.name.toUpperCase()
            : person.name}
        </button>
      ))}
      <DetailView initialEmail={selected.email} />
    </div>
  )
}

function DetailView({ initialEmail }) {
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState(initialEmail)

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={email}
        onChange={(event) => setEmail(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={() => alert(email)}>
        Apply
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

render(<App />)
```

Three ways to solve this  
  
1- Conditionally render the DetailView  

```ts
{selected && (
        <div
          style={{
            position: 'fixed',
            top: '0',
            left: '0',
            paddingTop: '100px',
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.4)',
          }}
        >
          <div
            style={{
              display: 'flex',
              justifyContent: 'center',
              width: '80%',
              height: '50vh',
              margin: 'auto',
              backgroundColor: 'white',
            }}
          >
            <DetailView initialEmail={selected.email} close={close} />
            <span style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }} onClick={close}>
              &times;
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
```
  
This works because the component is mounted and unmounted, thus the state is reset and uses the initial value passed to it.  
  
2- lifting state up  

```ts
function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(persons[0])
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState(selected.email)

...

  <DetailView email={email} setEmail={setEmail} />

}
```
  
By removing the state from the details component it is then updated by the parent, so no props to state  
  
The problem is the whole app rerenders on every change to the email  
  
3- Fully uncontrolled with a key  

```ts
<DetailView key={selected.id} initialEmail={selected.email} />
```
  
By setting the email as key, the component is unmounted and re-mounted every time it the email changes, thus solving the issue.  
  
"Please mount this whenever the key changes. As long as the key is the same, please re-render"  
  
4- the non solution  
  
We could have used an effect to sync state with props, but this is an anti pattern, because effects are for syncing react with stuff outside react.

```
function DetailView({ initialEmail }) {
    const [email, setEmail] = React.useState(initialEmail)

    React.useEffect(() => {
        setEmail(initialEmail)
    }, [initialEmail])

    return (...)
}
```
