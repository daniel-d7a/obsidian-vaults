1: The functional updater  

Helps when we need to update the state more than once in the same call and also avoids dependencies of useEffect, useCallback, â€¦etc  

```ts
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

// ðŸš¨ depends on the current count value to calculate the next value
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>

// âœ… uses previousCount to calculate next value
<button onClick={() => setCount(previousCount => previousCount + 1)}>Increment</button>
```

```ts
function Counter({ incrementBy = 1 }) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  // ðŸš¨ will create a new function whenever count changes because we closure over it
  const increment = React.useCallback(() => setCount(count + incrementBy), [
    incrementBy,
    count,
  ])

  // âœ… avoids this problem by not using count at all
  const increment = React.useCallback(
    () => setCount((previousCount) => previousCount + incrementBy),
    [incrementBy]
  )
}
```

Bonus2: Toggling state with useReducer  

You can use a reducer for toggle as it is easier than using a state setter  

```ts
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(true)  

<button onClick={() => setValue(previousValue => !previousValue)}>Toggle</button>  
```

vs

```ts
const [value, toggleValue] = React.useReducer(previous => !previous, true)  

<button onClick={toggleValue}>Toggle</button>  
```

2: The lazy initializer  

When we pass an initial value to useState, the initial variable is always created, but React will only use it for the first render  

When initializing a state, pass an arrow function that returns the initial state, this will prevent the initial value from being calculated on every render, even if it is not used.  

```ts
// ðŸš¨ will unnecessarily be computed on every render
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
  calculateExpensiveInitialValue(props)
)

// âœ… looks like a small difference, but the function is only called once
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(() =>
  calculateExpensiveInitialValue(props)
)
```

3: The update bailout  

React will not rerender if the new state equals the previous state using [Object.is](http://object.is/)  

```ts
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('Elias')

  // ðŸ¤¯ clicking this button will not re-render the component
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setName('Elias')}>
      Name is: {name}, Date is: {new Date().getTime()}
    </button>
  )
}

render(<App />)
```

In the example the date doesn't update as the component doesn't rerender when setting the state  

4: The convenience overload  

When using typescript you can initialize the state with a value, its type will be inferred, or not initialize it but give it a type parameter and its type will be type or null  

```ts
// ðŸš¨ age will be inferred to `undefined` which is kinda useless
const [age, setAge] = React.useState(undefined)

// ðŸ†— but a bit lengthy
const [age, setAge] = React.useState<number | null>(null)
```

5: The implementation detail  

Use state is implemented using use reducer
