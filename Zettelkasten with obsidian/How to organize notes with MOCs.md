For MOC refere [[Glossary#MOC|here]]

Use this [[Glossary#dataview|dataview]] query in an index note to list all notes referring to it, and in any note related to the topic add a link to the index note. 

```dataview
list from [[]] and !outgoing([[]])
```

This gets all li

We can further refine our index by dividing it into topics using a subheader and a more specific query.
