We can use the graph view to review notes that we might have forgotten, and also allows us to spot notes with little or no links.

Using graph view has the disadvantage of viewing all notes, even ones that we don't want to see (project details, daily notes, journal entries, ...etc)

Maps of contents and index notes help a lot here.

We can use the[[Glossary#dataview | dataview]] extension, which seemingly allows us to make queries on our vaults, but I haven't tried it yet.

With dataview, we can query for notes older than a certain date, or notes with a specific tag, or even just random notes.
