add the examples in the book to the notes markdown.

i started adding examples and <<>> from chapter 5 

add umls and class diagrams in the notes.

add code examples
check if the code examples are well labeled in the books's repo and just link that instead. 

any <<>> means that we need to add something here.

I have ommited the excercises
