### The 7 Cs of youtube success

1. Courage
2. Clarity
	- define your audience, don't try to each everybody.
	- define what the channel about.
	- what's your YouTube business plan (????????????) aka the long term plan for this.
	- riches are in the niches.
3. Channel
	- have a clean channel with a good avatar and banner.
	- a strong name
	- link to your website or social media
	- make a channel trailer
	- organize videos with playlists
4. Content
5. Community
	- you only need a 1000 true fans to create a community (and possibly earn money)
	- think how to create value for your audience first, then the income will follow.
	- connect with the community, respond to messages, comments, …etc.
6. Cash
	- based on the niche I am in what is the shortest path to revenue (maybe viral videos to get ads and ad money, or maybe you want the videos to get you clients)
7. Consistency
	- YouTube burnout is real.
	- I need to build a routine to avoid burnout and build a lasting creator career.
	- how to create more in less time?
	- how to create more videos with less energy?
	- it is about having a YouTube-life balance.

this is a continuous cycle for improvement, and I shall reevaluate it on every major change in my life.

## 10 Steps to get 100 new subs every day?

I must focus on the rate new people subscribe to my channel by doing it intentionally.

1. upload consistently
	- have a schedule for uploads of different types.
2. write clickable titles
	- make AI write titles for you.
3. give people a reason to subscribe
	- tell them the result of subscribing (level up their learning, learn new stuff, get the latest info, earn a promotion, save time, …etc.)
	- add a call to subscribe.
4. high value comments on bigger channels
5. improve the content
	- each video should have a promise (in the title) and a payoff (in the actual content)
	- the viewer should get the payoff early and (hopefully) multiple times.
6. collaborate with other creators
	- you want to collaborate with others who have he same audience as you, so new subs continue watching videos.
	- interviews, 2 related videos, one on each channel.
	- find creators at your level.
7. focus on ever green content.
8. share the content in a community in a way that adds value.
9. rank the videos
	- ranked videos keep showing up in search result or get suggested by youtube.
	- how ????????????????
10. don't quit.
	- great things take time and energy.

## How to write YouTube titles that get views

1. is the title benefit driven
	- see note above
2. unique and fresh
	- use chatGPT
3. speak to desires and ambitions of viewers
	- try tapping into health, wealth, or relationships (if you can)
	- this video will (save you time, money, give you energy, …etc.)
	- you must understand the viewers deepest ambitions and desires.
	- you can lead with a question
4. the title should call out specific audience
	- you eliminate many people but you attract better audience.
5. speak of a problem and promise to solve it.
6. the title creates curiosity and makes you want to click.
	- make a promise and the payoff must be in the video
	- better when you have momentum.
7. it opens a loop and doesn't give the video away.
	- have the video reveal something new, or by someone important.
8. maybe the title is a question that the viewer has.
	- the video must answer specific questions.
9. taps into fear or pain.
	- people are driven by (or probably away from) fear and pain.
	- this is not only in the title but also in the topic itself
	- tap into fears but deliver hope and truth.

we can always change the title or the thumbnail later. we can also use the community to help us chose the title and the thumbnail.

*I got to say many of these things don't help an educational channel like mine very much, I teach and talk about programming, I am not a news anchor like theo or the primagen*
