#notes/books

Start by actually taking notes.

We want to take atomic notes, notes that can stand on their own without context and still be useful.

Make index lists for stuff you read (articles, books, .. etc)

Use indexes and block links inside long or dense notes.

We want notes that can be reused multiple times, small enough to be reused but big enough to hold information.

- Big index note about topic
    - smaller notes about big ideas with links to other notes
        -   small ideas

Use fleeting notes to capture quick thoughts and ideas, and to remind yourself about the idea for later.

Fleeting notes are only useful if we turn them into permanent notes.

Notes should be either thrown away, archived, or turned into permanent notes.

Use permanent notes to refactor fleeting notes useful notes you can use later.

Use links to create a web of notes that reference each other.

Instead of writing a new note for every new thing you see, improve on existing notes.
