## Using shorts [^1]

YouTube pushes your shorts to people watching your long form content, so make good long form videos so the shorts appear, then make shorts to get subs.

try to loop the videos so the end aligns with the start.

shoot the video to be a short from the beginning, add subtitles, use a catchy title, and make it about something viral.
