nothing much to talk about, the only notable thing is that I got out of the house and had a little walk, I noticed that my army card had money in it so I went to one of the nearest ATMs to withdraw it, about 800 pounds.

I also had my big moment with vibe coding yesterday, I wanted to implement a rich text editor in my inertia blog with a URL drop down based on the tip tap editor, so I asked deep-seek to make it for me as it was a new component, I gave it all the needed info and requirements and it created an almost flawless component, made me study the financial benefits of subscribing to cursor and other tools such as Claude code and task-manager ai, now that I have 2 jobs I guess that is the piece that I need, but that is going to make a heavy dent in my pocket.

the ERP company talked to me yesterday and I kindly declined their offer as I had a deal more aligned with my career goals, and told the guy that refered me and apologized to him for not telling him sooner

I also made some chicken and potato.
