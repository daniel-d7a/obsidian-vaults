[[Thinking, studying, how our brains work.]]

basically it boils down to 3 things:

- have a large annual view that shows the most significant task of every day.
- have a weekly view that you use to block time for tasks and events, especially reoccurring ones.
- have a daily list of what you do, so you can follow it, usually it is from the weekly view.
I need a weekly plan \ task list.
