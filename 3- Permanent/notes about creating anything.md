### Tips on how to write consistenly

henry miller has a few commandments that he follows when he writes books, here are they :

> 1. Work on one thing at a time until finished._
> 2. _Start no more new books, add no more new material to “Black Spring.”_
> 3. _Don’t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand._
> 4. _Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!_
> 5. _When you can’t create you can work._
> 6. _Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers._
> 7. _Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it._
> 8. _Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only._
> 9. _Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude._
> 10. _Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing._
> 11. _Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come_ afterward.

most of the advice in the commandments can be distilled into these notes:

- work on one thing at a time, don't start any new things untill it is finished.
- make working a routine, not based on your mood or conditions.
- enjoy the work and stop when you don't.
- be human, live life, see friends, go places, but not on the expense of doing work.

### Just start

> you can always edit a bad page, you can't edit a blank page
> -  Jodi Picoult

she is saying just fucking start

### Most of what you will write will be based

most of the ideas are bad, but we have to weed out the bad to find the good.

### Use outlines

make an outline, then a more detailed outline, and a more one, an so on and so on until you have a piece at hand.

when writing it is ok to rewrite the idea or the draft, it is just a sketch that needs many things added to it to become an actual piece.

### Write for yourself, not for the others

write bout the things that you feel like, not for some audience.

### I need to get moving

Pushing yourself physically prepares you to work hard mentally, many of the writers mentioned in this article have some sort of exercise in their lives, I need to get out there.

### Do the most important thing first

right when I wake up and after breakfast (if there is breakfast) I have to go do the most important thing on my list

## Notes from ali abdaal

### Don't make it optional

when we make something optional we add the options of not making it or doing it, remove that and you are forced to do it.
