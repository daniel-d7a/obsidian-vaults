## UML

- unified modifying language.
- used to describe classes to other people regarding structure, properties and functions.

## Inheritance

- a class extends another by reusing its code and ading functionality (variables and functions) or overriding exisiting functionality.
- promotes reusability and avoids repetition and duplication.

## Polymorphism

- is when a subclass stands for its superclass.
- allows code to be more flexible and resistant to change.

## encapsulation

- separating or hiding some code form the rest of the code.
- could be done through access modifiers (private/public) or methods.
- you can encapsulate data or behaviour.
- allows you to control how the code is used.
