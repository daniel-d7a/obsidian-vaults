[[Thinking, studying, how our brains work.]]

## 1. Mental contrasting

basically imagining where you are now and where you want to be and the obstacles in the way. this give you a clearer image in your journey.

## 2. Implementation intentions

this ties with the first tip where you imagine the obstacles that are going to face you in your tasks then think of what to do should you ever encounter them. this is also useful for learning new habits, by thinking of the new habits you want and then stack them together with old habits.

## 3. Reduce friction

redesign the environment to make the things you want to do easier and the things you don't harder.

## 4. Monitoring and tracking

what gets measured get managed and what gets managed gets improved.

tracking activities gives us:

- motivation, because seeing change motivates us to do more.
- feedback, so we know what works and what doesn't
- clarity, again so that we can adjust what we do to be better.

## 5. Make it enjoyable and energizing
