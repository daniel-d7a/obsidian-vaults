## Folder structure 
- **\_:** holds miscellaneous files, such as *templates*, *inbox* for newly created notes, *unorganized* for migrating notes across structures.
- **MOCs**
- **Fleeting notes**
- **Permanent notes** 
- **Journal:** for daily notes and notes about my life in genera.
- **Think box:** for thinking about new projects.

## Note structure 
- use tags to separate notes by topics
- use nested tags to split the notes further by subtopics and states.
- use templates with unified metadata to group together special notes such as my articles

## Ideas
- use scripts to migrate notes structure.
