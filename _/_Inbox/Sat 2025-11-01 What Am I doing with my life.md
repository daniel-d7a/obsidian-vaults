every day I fall into the same loop where I just hop from one app into the other throwing my days away without doing anything of use.

I wrote a bunch of stuff to do better than being on the phone, deactivated my facebook account, and added a timer on twitter.

all I want is that instead of wasting my time away on useless apps and games (and by useless here I am also saying that they don't bring me any joy too), I want to waste my time reading or making stuff, I want to have stuff to be proud of in this world
