[[Thinking, studying, how our brains work.]]

it simply discusses the idea of batching tasks by:

- place
- need of internet
- energy level: know when you have most energy then do the most taxing tasks at that time.
- time: when a task have a set time it can't take place at any other time
- tools
- social interaction: do you need to be with people or not.

this reduces the startup and clean up cost of tasks and reduces cognitive switching (i.e. the mental penalty resulting from switching tasks)
