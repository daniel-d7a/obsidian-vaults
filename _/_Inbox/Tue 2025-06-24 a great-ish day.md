today went great-ish, I have time to meet bahaa tomorrow in Alexandria as I am on top of my work.

I filmed 4 chapters of CSS for hash plus, filmed my own docker video for the blog vlog, and the mic worked well enough through it all, I still gonna get another though when I have money.

I had my first task with power I tech today, Ahmed shared the theme file with me so that I can check out the code, and see how everything worked.

I eat the rest of the potatos in 3 sandwiches with lots of sauces.

I kinda miss the sugerfull life that I used to live, now I can go a few days without having a softdrink or an ice cream, which I know is healthier, but the sweetness hits different though, maybe I am drunk on life so that I don't need suger as much, or maybe I am high on love ? if you can even call what I am in love, but we shall see, whenever I have money I will ask her out for anything, so that I can see her and also get to know her more.
