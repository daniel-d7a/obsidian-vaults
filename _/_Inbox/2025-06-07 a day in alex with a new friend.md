I did a lot of things that day

first of all I met a really nice girl, who we actually haven't met before, we sat by the sea, we had ice cream, we talked a lot, we laughed a lot, we discussed many things, it was like we knew each other long before we met.

and we did all that in Alexandria, which was fantastic to say the least.

another thing that I did was that I tried to pick up a really cute girl that was just standing by the train station, I got turned down immediately but it was worth it, the girl was stupid hot.

I also got a new book to commemorate the day, I got 1984, people say it is a great book, and I agree, I love George Orwell, haven't read the book yet but I am certain of it.
