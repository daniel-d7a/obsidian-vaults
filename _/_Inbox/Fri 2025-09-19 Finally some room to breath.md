Some stuff finally finished, hash plus Live streams, tajer project, work is winding down and I have some time to play games (currently playing death loop and it slaps)

Then rises the issue of having to readjust my times and plan or block my free time, this last week I have been playing non stop every waking minute that I didn't have to work, which was nice and felt deserved, but I cannot go on like that.

I need to start blocking time and using timers, start work or whatever with a page or two of Quran, read in the breaks and before bed instead of playing clash royale. (that last one I am very guilt of)

Also we should fill the recently claimed free time with personal project, articles (both reading and writing, quick fyi, not everything is worth reading), gaming (yeet), videos (I feel my recording muscle is getting weaker by the day, miss the days where I could finish hours of prep and recording in a day)

I should really fix some time and duration for social media, and prefer YouTube and reading over other forms of consumption.
