This day is simply a continuation of yesterday, refer to [[2025-06-16 having my friends over]]

However, one thing that I want to write about here is Salma, once again, yesterday we talked a bit, our chats are usually short, like very short, I showed her us making pasta and chicken, and asked about her, but noticed that at the same time she posted a story with a kinda sad, kinda nihilist quote, when I asked her about it she said she felt a bit sad, because of no one and nothing, but just a bit down, 
و انا نقطة ضعفي دموع حوا
So as the good friend that I am, I tried comforting her, sent her one of my favorite drawings from Mehasen, and wrote her a few calming words.

She liked that, and I guess she felt a bit better, she sent me many hearts, those 💗 not the red ones, I guess I scored non the less.

The thing is why did I do all that? why did I go the extra mile of choosing some nice art, carefully placing together words? I don't have a concrete answer, and I don't want to foolishly say "Love", but I can't deny that I feel a connection, maybe it is the fact that we skipped a few steps in the usual path of knowing someone, maybe I am still recovering from the army, still remembering how a normal human male behaves around females with varying degrees of closeness.

One other thing to notice is that it might be love, as I have a witnesses record of suppressing and denying my feelings, especially love, so we may be at some cross roads here, the only way out of this is a therapist lmao.
