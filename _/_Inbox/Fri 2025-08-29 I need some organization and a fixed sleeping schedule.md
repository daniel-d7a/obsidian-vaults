Basically the title, I need a plan for everyday so that I don't drift off to social media, and I also need to sleep and wake up at similar times everyday so that I can create a routine and get fixed work and free periods of time.

I need to set somethings to be done daily and weekly like:
- gym 5 days a week
- quran everyday
- play games kinda everyday
- write in here kinda everyday 
- Read before sleep
- work on head first videos everyday

We need to finish some stuff so we can do others like:
- finish Nuxt course
- finish Head first book
- finish Head first videos

We need to get back to stuff we kinda left like:
- person projects 
- YouTube channel 
- blog

I don't know how I am going to do all that with more work coming my way, but even doing the smallest actions here in there is a win for me.

And I want to answer an important question, what comes after all this work?
I feel I am overworked, not enough free time, so many things lining back to back and killing any opportunity to go out and see my friends, I was in for the money, and money is what I got, but in return for what? I am seeing a future of me overworking myself and I only justify it by sinking into consumerism and buying shit wether I need it or not, just because I have the money.

I don't even know what I need all that money for, not that I don't need money, everyone does, but I am not in
