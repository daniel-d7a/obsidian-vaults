I started looking and applying for jobs today. I was on linked in and Bayt, and applied to any job that I felt like I was appropriate for, and now all I have to do is wait for some feedback, either good or bad.

another important thing that is happening right now is Salma, I am feeling some attraction towards her, thanks to being in the army for a year away from any connection with a female, a nice day in Alex with her, her being a very likable person and dare I also say my type, and some (ok a lot) of pushing from Shahd. Now I feel that I want to talk to her a lot, every day, I wonder why she doesn't talk to me often, I don't want to push it but I can't deny it.

I also can't deny the fact that I am wroth nothing as a man right now, I am jobless, I have no money to my name, I am actually in debt, and my parents still pay for my stuff, which sucks a little but it is going to change soon, but that doesn't change the fact that no matter how nice she is or how much I feel attracted to her (I don't know if I like or love her yet), I can't take any steps in that direction as I am broke.
