Here’s a refined structure based on your preferences:

Folder Structure (Minimal Nesting)

/Notes/ → All main notes (atomic, interconnected).

/Literature Notes/ → Summaries and insights from books, articles, etc.

/Fleeting Notes/ → Quick, unprocessed notes before refinement.

/MOCs/ → Index notes linking related topics (e.g., Programming MOC.md, AI MOC.md).

/Inbox/ (Optional) → Temporary holding area for unsorted notes.

Best Practices

Use tags (#programming, # CS, # AI) for categorization.

Connect notes using internal links ([[Related Note]]).

Create MOCs for key topics instead of deep folder nesting.

Periodically refine fleeting notes into permanent notes.
