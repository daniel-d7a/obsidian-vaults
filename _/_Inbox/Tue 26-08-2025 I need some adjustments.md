this month is flying by.

I am starting to think that my idea of overworking myself for money wasn't the best, because all I am getting is tired, I have nearly no free time, and so far I don't feel the benefits of it, there is money for sure, but it is scattered a bit among many sources, not all comes at the same time, they event don't end up in the same account.

at the end of the month I should be making about 30k-ish divided as follows

- 13k salary (after a little salary bump, 16k after 2 months)
- 7k from F5 Logistics
- 6k from Hashplus
- 4k from Eraasoft
- ~2k from Ersaa
I am also working on a freelance project this month, netting me an extra ~4k, which is little I know, never again, but as much as it is low on money it is high on learning. I would like to have at least one freelance project every month.

I have some doubts about some of these, like hashplus is getting very low traction, so I think they might stop it next month. We are doing bad with F5, mainly Omar the frontend guy, we are way behind schedule and they won't be wrong to terminate us.

But to counter that I should be starting other courses with Ersaa and Eraasoft that would make me a nice sum of money or even cover anything that fails.

How would know that with Mo money comes Mo problems, I have some money, I need to save some of it in a way that doesn't depreciate (mainly gold), mom and dad are helping me with this as that also helps them, they buy me gold now and I give them the money later instead of having to send us money, very neat I would say.

also I need some way so save money short term, so a money group it is, the thing with these is that getting into one with very long circulation will actually lose you money, luckily I found a really short one.

but I would rather not get into a money group and invest the money into some business that would have some return on it instead, or even start some small business with someone with some of my money.

as I am writing this it came to me that I can invest with my cousin, he just started selling football merch, I can invest with some money and even make them a website on Wuilt, so that I am not only invested with money.

One other thing about money is that this is the first time I am having this much money and - more importantly - this much money as a somewhat steady stream of income, so I was thinking of buying myself something nice, I was thinking a Samsung tablet, that would set me back around 20k give or take a few thousand pounds, used of course. on the other hand I don't know if I need it or even if I should, or what can I spoil myself with.

Money aside, I have nearly no free time, I can barely play a game everyday, I can't go out with no one, I can't travel to Cairo to see my friends, I have to stay up late and miss stuff because I am so overworked.

I need to fix my sleeping schedule, to wake up early, go to the gym early, sleep early.

I need to readjust my life, get back to my habits and replace doom scrolling with some other better activities that like better like reading.

I need to get back to making stuff, creating content, learning new things, and all the good things that I used to do.
