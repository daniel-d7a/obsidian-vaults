defined as being bold, daring, often with disregard to conventional rules.

you can just do stuff:

- create videos
- make food
- play musical instruments
- …etc

when doing stuff do them as if people already enjoy what you are doing, don't make yourself smaller or quiter.

don't listen to the haters, actually remove the haters.

Just do it ✔

also you don't have to use your full potential, if a project is getting cumbersome, just leave it, also not everything has to be a business.

It is more about not letting people stop you from using your potential
