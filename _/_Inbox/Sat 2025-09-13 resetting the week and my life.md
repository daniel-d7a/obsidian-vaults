I am now setting through delivering the freelance project called tajer, on this project I worked as a backend dev with node.js and hono, working with drizzle and zod, and deploying on cloudflare. I worked with a random frontend that found me online, he was the one who came with the project and needed a backend dev with him.

I am writing this because I have a few thoughts about this, since I was working on this for the last month delivering it is a milestone for my life and habits. And today being Saturday is a checkpoint for the week where I take a moment to reorganize and reset for the new week, maybe even game a little bit.

first of all, that frontend guy is very inexperienced, weather being in writing code or in selling his work, and this client is a professional client, he knows what he wants and points out little inconsistenties in the work. I finished my work early, and he always had stuff to do, I didn't keep him waiting, I wrote good code, and gave him whatever that he needed, but I usually found him late, writing bad code, it seems to me that he didn't work on large projects a lot and he needs to up his game if we shall keep working together.

the delivery is working right now and I hope it passes, I want to get rid of this client, it is not the project, it is not the money, it is not the frontend, I just don't like the man, I feel like he is like a snake that doesn't like anything we give him.

I actually liked the project, this is my first e-commerce project, and surprisingly I did it as a backend, it had some nice and fairly complex logic, and many things that didn't cross my mind before. I also liked hono, drizzle is great, deploying on cloudflare was a nice learning experience, all that made me consider using it if I ever need a project or for clients, and it is a great skill for my resume.

For my week I want to take it easier, play more games, do more of the stuff that I actually want.

I want to use less social media, but the idea is it has some qualities that makes it hard to replace, I can use it any time for any amount of time, if I can find something with similar qualities, I will replace it. However for no the time limits shall suffice.

I want to read more, and I am actually reading a really nice book, so that shouldn't be hard.

I want to read more quran, this I shall do once I wake up.

speaking of waking up, I need a fixed sleeping schedule, where I wake up at 9 and sleep at 1 or 2. that should be great.

I need to go to the gym three time a week at least, I will make fixed time for them.

I should put more time to game and watch stuff, or just have free time to work on my YouTube channel or blog, or even make projects of my own.

maybe instead of going to social media I can read and share articles, the issue is that when I use social media I do it to free my mind from the pressure of work, and articles kinda seem like a pressure of their own, I want to do something active (not doom scrolling) that is entertaining and not killing my brain and energy slowly every time I do it.
